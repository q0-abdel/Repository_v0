# My Programming Journey

## About Me
I'm starting my journey in programming from scratch. While I don't have prior coding experience, I'm excited to develop my programming skills and explore the possibilities that modern AI-powered tools offer. I'm particularly interested in using cutting-edge AI development environments like Windsurf IDE, which enables Vibe Coding - a new way of creating software with AI assistance.

## My Goals
- Learn programming fundamentals
- Create my own tools and applications
- Leverage AI-powered development tools to enhance my learning
- Build practical solutions for real-world problems

## This Project
This is my first Python program - a simple "Hello, World!" application. While it may seem basic, it represents my first step into the world of programming and marks the beginning of my journey to become a developer.

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your computer
2. Open a terminal or command prompt
3. Navigate to the project directory
4. Run the command: `python my-first-program.py`

## What I've Learned So Far
- Basic Python syntax
- How to write and run a simple program
- Using GitHub for version control
- Working with AI-assisted development tools
- Creating and updating documentation

## Next Steps
I plan to continue learning and building more complex programs, taking advantage of AI tools to help me understand best practices and modern development techniques.
